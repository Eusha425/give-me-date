# Give Me Day

A program that tells what the day is going to be of a specified date. 

It can accurately tell the day of any date from the 17th Century upto the 21th Century.

## Appendix

It solves a mathematical problem know as [Calendar Problems/Tricks](https://www.hitbullseye.com/Calendar-Tricks.php) to find the day. The user inputs a date, a month and a year and the program will calculate the actual day of that date. Tkinter liabrary is used for the UI, PIL is used to add an image to the interface. 





## Usage

To use the program, download the two [python files](https://github.com/Eusha425/give-me-day) and the [picture]() included. Have the python files and the picture in the same folder as it is the background image of the app.
